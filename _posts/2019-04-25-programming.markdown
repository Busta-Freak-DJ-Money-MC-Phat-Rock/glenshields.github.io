# What is computer programming?
According to Wikipedia (the most trustworthy source in existence), computer programming is *"the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task."*

# What are some uses of computer programming?
Programming is obviously a mandatory skill for most computer software related careers (system developer, web developer, application developer, network administrator, game developer etc.), but programming is also an important tool in many other fields.

Physicists use computer programs to run simulations and to analyze experiment data.

Mathematicians needed a computer to prove the [four color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) and to solve the [Boolean Pythagorean triples problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem).

Game theorists used about **35 CPU-years of idle computer time** to find **[God's Number](https://www.cube20.org/)**, the maximum number of moves required to solve a Rubik's Cube from any position.

# What makes computers so powerful?
Computers are much better than humans at doing repetitive tasks. For example, if I wanted to find all occurences of the word "important" in a 2000-page PDF, it would take an average human around 40 hours of continuous reading, but a computer would only need a few seconds.

# Should I learn computer programming?
Computer programming is different from math and science. It is not a study. It is a tool. **If you will never need to use programming as a tool, learning it is just a waste of your time.**
