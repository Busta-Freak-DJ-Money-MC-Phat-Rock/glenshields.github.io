*Infrequently Asked Questions*

# How long did it take to build this blog?

# What makes this blog better than blogs created with Wordpress or Blogger?
*[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) are both dynamic websites, meaning that every time a user requests to see a page, the server needs to find the page in the database, generate HTML code for it, and hand it to the user.*

*This site is a static website, meaning that the HTML code for every page already exists, and can be directly accessed. This allows static websites to load much faster than dynamic websites.*

*Writing the HTML code for each page would be too tedious, so we used an open-source tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which converts [Markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/) to HTML.*
